Procedural map generation in Visual C# as part of MCSD 70-843 Certificate training

-----

The idea is to generate a map from scratch, using various techniques.

A possible plan for this is as follows:

1. Given parameters for a world size, randomize the location of plate tectonics
2. Using tectonic activity and plate boundaries, estimate elevation

3. Work hard
